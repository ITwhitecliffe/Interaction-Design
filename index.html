    <h1>Research Case study for H.A.T</h1>
    <h3>project overview</h3>
    <P>
        H.A.T is mean Human, Art, Technology. This is a creative research project that contains stories or roadmap, that empowers people to learn and have fun as human. 
        When a loved one dies, we also sadly loose their stories. 
        Memento Media uses storytelling and oral history practices to redefine the way families discover, capture and celebrate family history without multi-generational living family archives.
